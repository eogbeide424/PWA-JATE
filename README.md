## Description

 On this project we had to add to the code given and make sure that when we enter npm start at the root directory 1. the server starts 2. the JavaScript files gets bundled using webpack 3. make sure that IndexDb immeadiately creates a database storage  4. when  you click off the dom  window that the data has been saved  5. then when you click the install button that the application saves  onto your desktop . At first  it was confusing seperating the client from the server and making sure that build run smoothly without error what I came to find out is thtat the package.json had a lot to do with it . If the root package.json dosen't have the correct scripts(refer to the snippet below) then it would not build run or anything it'll just give you an error message.
 ````javascript
 "scripts": {
    "start:dev": "concurrently \"cd server && npm run server\" \"cd client && npm run dev\"",
    "start": "npm run build && cd server && node server.js",
    "server": "cd server nodemon server.js --ignore client",
    "build": "cd client && npm run build",
    "install": "cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i",
    "client": "cd client && npm start"
  },
  ````
Another thing to note was how idb used the built in methods of openDb to handle request similar to how an API server does with a put request to update and a get request to retrieve, I didn't have to utillize it in this particular project but you can even do a Delete and post request 
````javaScript
export const getDb = async () =>{
console.error('getDb not implemented');
const jateDb = await openDB('JATE', 1);
const tx = jateDb.transaction('jate', 'readwrite');
const store = tx.objectStore('jate');
const request = store.get('id');
const result = await request;
console.log(result);
}
````
Learning how to do this manually makes me appreciate the fact that React does all this under the hood for you
